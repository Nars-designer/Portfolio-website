			<h1>Intro.</h1> 
			<p><b>I made this openable globe for my 
			geography teacher. He struggled with visualizing the 
			theory everytime when he explained the inside of the earth 
			and how vulcanos and earthqakes work. With this tool 
			he can provide the students with a visual representation 
			of the world including fracture lines and the cores theory.

			<h1>Start</h1>
			<p>I bought a second-hand globe online and cut it in two pieces with 
			a saw. This was actually a bit tricky because, there was a chance the globe would 
			shatter in pieces instead of dividing in two nice parts. 
			But I was lucky and succeeded in sawing the globe in two. 
			Then I Started with drawing. 
			My first idea was to fill the globe with some kind of plastic 
			so it was possible to take the layers of the inside of the earth out to show it piece by piece
			to the students. After some calculations I discovered that this idea was very expensive 
			and complicated. While my geography teacher only wanted a cut open globe. 
			So I decided to make only a flat layer inside and paint the layers of the earth upon it</p>

			<h1>Next</h1>
			<p> The globe I brought was a little outdated so I decided to paint it over 
			(I also had to paint it over because I damaged some of the plastic at the edges). 
			I started with all the rivers they were really thin so I used a wooden skewer to cover them. 
			After this I started to colour the land pieces starting with al the green and working 
			to brownish for the desserts.  I finished with the seas and the white ice. 
			This all took me till the summer of 2017 to complete.  </p>

			<h1>Meanwhile, </h1>	
			<p>Painting the outer shell of the globe piece 
			by piece. I brainstormed about how the globe would open and how I could design the inside. 
			I wanted to use durable materials (no paper or cardboard) so I bought two thin cutting boards 
			at Ikea and cut them in the circular shape of the globe. I pasted them on the inside 
			(I tried different types of glue until I discovered one that worked).
			 I sawed the frame in two and screwed a tiny hinge between them so I could open and 
			close it.</p>

			<h1>Then</h1>	
			<p>I started with the inside but something went wrong with the calculation 
			of the proportions. I made a mistake somewhere becuse the crust is way too thick. 
			So I went back to the drawing board and comminucated with the teacher about how he 
			wanted the globe to look like.</p>

			<h1>Final result and conclusion</h1>	
			<p>Almost three years of working on this project I finished it and gave it to my teacher. What makes this product so special?
			Well it contains a comination of visal information. The outershell visualizes the continents and I included the fracture lines with glow in the dark paint.
			The inside of the globe shows the different layers and the way the heat of the core moves the continent. I also made the different kinds of earthcrust visible.</p>
