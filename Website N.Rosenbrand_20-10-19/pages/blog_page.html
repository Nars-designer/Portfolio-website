			<p>Tonight I helped at the open day of my university. I was actually invited there by one of the teachers to showcase a project from the first year (<a href="pages/project_waterheroes.html" id="project_waterheroes">Waterheroes</a>). I really liked it to welcome potential students and meet students from other years.</p>

			<p>Tonight was amazing. I received my (second) propaedeutic! It was in the evening and I was allowed to take 3 people with me so I asked my parents and sister to come. Upon arrival we were welcomed with coffee and cake and after that we were called to the front of the room individually, to sign our papers and to give a short speech. Last year was amazing and I hope to contine with this great study!  </p>
