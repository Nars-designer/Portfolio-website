			<h1>Intro.</h1> 
			<p><b>This was a team project from the fourth quartile of my first year in CMGT. The team existed of six members: One engineer, two designers and three artists. The goal of the project was to make a chain-reaction combined with a puzzle game for the visitors of the local Makers festival. The goal of this festival was to educate children (age 5-12) and their parents about the importance of technology and creativity for the future.

			<h1>Brainstorm</h1>
			<p>With that purpose in mind we came up with a concept. We wanted to send a message with our project besides making it a fun experience. That’s how we came up with WaterHeroes, a concept to teach children about clean water.</p>

			<h1>The game</h1>
			<p>At first we wanted to implement fluid-simulation, but sadly enough our engineer wasn’t able to implement it in the game-engine we had to work with. We chose to use a ball to represent the water. The goal of the game was to guide the ball through a track using objects like an inclination to help it forward. </p>

			<h1>The chain reaction </h1>	
			<p>At the start we planned to use real water for the chain-reaction, but as soon we realized that it was a bit dangerous to have water around electronics we decided that a glass marble could represent water as well. The machine starts by dropping a brown glass marble on a button concealed by a wooden structure. For the visitor it seems like the ball disappears into the machine and appears on the screen. After the game is finished a servomotor opens a lever at the other end of the machine and makes another transparent glass marble roll down the chain reaction.</p>

			<h1>The planning</h1>	
			<p>During this project I was the team member responsible for planning and organization. We used scrum to plan weekly sprints which were divided in smaller parts by user stories. Trello was the center of or plan infrastructure because that was the place all the user stories, requirements and progress came together. We labeled tasks per role and per member and moved them around between the backlog, work in progress, testing or finished. 
			We divided the tasks between the roles and in general: The engineer built all the functionalities of the game in the GXP engine and connected it to the Arduino-output, 
			the designers were responsible for planning, presentations, website, promotional materials, stylesheet, Arduino hardware and UX/UI 
			and the artists made the mood boards, 2D-art, animations and the physical chain reaction.

			<h1>The final result </h1>	
			<p>Our project came together nicely, and it was well received by our teachers and the representatives of the festival. After the grading we were invited to present our installation at the makers festival together with the other winning teams! It didn’t stop there, since our appearance at the makers festival we were invited to show our project at another festival for children and at the open days of our study.</p>
