			<h1>Intro.</h1> 
			<p><b>I used to have an Excel file that I used for every team-project and occasionally for my own planning. My team-mates always told me that they were very happy with how I lead the project as a scrum-master so, I assumed that my file was good. 
			But last project I showed it to a teacher who is very experienced with scrum and he told me that I actually don’t keep track of user stories properly, because I keep track of the amount of hours worked and measure that against the amount of hours that everyone should be working (like 7 hours) based on that I make my burndown charts. What I should be doing is dividing the tasks at the start of the sprint and estimating how much time the sprint is going to cost and compare that to the time it actually costed to finish the user stories (and make a burndown chart of that). So, that was reason number one why I wanted to review my planning methods the other reason is that I’m not very good at estimating how long a task will take me and I consider being able to estimate time that I need for a task as an important skill.

			<h1>Plan</h1>
			<p>To solve this, I decided to keep track of my tasks regarding schoolwork. So, at the start of each week I wrote down all the tasks that I had to do, as user stories and then I estimated how long it would take me to do them. After I finished each task I would write down how long it actually took me and I would take it with me as a lesson for the next week, when the same kind of task would be expected of me. Each week I wrote a log as well to keep track of my progress.</p>

			<h1>Conclusion </h1>	
			<p>After doing this for a quartile I learned to estimate how long something takes me and to make more realistic to-do lists for myself. I can go and calculate every moment that I had really large differences and analyze that instance. But I think that the main lesson in this process was that I just need to think twice before I think that I can do that in a day. By making a user story of it and writing down how much hours it will take make me I realize that I can’t do three things that will probably take each me 20 hours in a day. </p>

			<h1>Result </h1>	
			<p>My new file has three different kind of tabs; In one I keep track of the user stories, the hours they took and who did them it also has the burndown-chart. Each member has their own tab where they keep track of their own user stories and the and one in which I make daily blogposts.Although the two versions look a bit the same, the new one offers a clearer view of what a person is currently doing and helps with better keeping track of individual hours. In the future I would like to automate parts of the process since now it requires a lot of copying and pasting. <a href="Scrum_overview_template.htm" target="_blank" id="LExcel"> Click here to visit the online version of my Excel file!</a>
